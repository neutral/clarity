# Action: capture-user-needs

Class: deterministic

Purpose: Make user and customer needs explicit for design and planning.

Inputs:
- Scope (paths/headings/labels)
- UX research notes or stakeholder input

Preconditions:
- Target audience/segment for the scope is known.
- Source input exists for need statements (research, support, stakeholder data).

Actions:
1) Identify key personas or customer segments.
2) Record user needs, pain points, and jobs to be done.
3) Add concrete use cases or scenarios when possible.
4) Separate observed needs from proposed solutions.

Outputs:
- User Need, Persona, and Use Case statements.

Quality checks:
- Each need maps to a persona/segment and at least one use case.
- Needs are phrased as outcomes/jobs, not implementation choices.
- Claims without evidence are labeled `Assumption` or `Question`.

Return-to-intake triggers:
- Persona/segment priority conflicts with stated goals or scope.
- Key user-need claims lack any credible source and block decisions.

Plan/report logging:
- Plan trace line: `capture-user-needs | trigger | needs captured | persona coverage | checks passed`.
- Report summary: user-need map, evidence posture, and unresolved audience gaps.
