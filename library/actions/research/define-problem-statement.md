# Action: define-problem-statement

Class: deterministic

Purpose: Make the problem and affected audience explicit before solutioning.

Inputs:
- Scope (paths/headings/labels)
- Stakeholder input, research notes, or discovery summaries

Preconditions:
- Problem context and affected audience are available in scope.
- Canonical sources for major claims are known or explicitly absent.

Actions:
1) State the problem in one or two sentences without proposing a solution.
2) Identify the primary audience or customer segment affected.
3) Capture the impact and urgency (why it matters now).
4) Note any opportunity framing or success signal if known.
5) Mark unknown context fields as `Question`.

Outputs:
- Problem Statement, Audience, and Opportunity statements.

Quality checks:
- Problem framing is solution-neutral.
- Affected audience/segment and impact are explicit.
- High-impact claims are evidence-linked or labeled `Assumption`/`Question`.

Return-to-intake triggers:
- Competing canonical problem statements conflict on core framing.
- Defining the problem requires changing intended outcome or non-goals.

Plan/report logging:
- Plan trace line: `define-problem-statement | trigger | statements drafted | unknowns | checks passed`.
- Report summary: finalized problem framing, evidence posture, and open questions.
