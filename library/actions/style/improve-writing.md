# Action: improve-writing

Class: editorial

Purpose: Reduce ambiguity and filler.

Inputs:
- Scope (paths/headings/labels)

Preconditions:
- Source meaning is understood and stable before editing.
- Terminology baseline is known for scoped content.

Actions:
1) Replace vague terms with precise language.
2) Use active voice and explicit subjects.
3) Split long sentences and remove hedging.
4) Preserve meaning while tightening phrasing.

Outputs:
- Tighter, more precise prose.

Quality checks:
- Meaning is preserved (no new decisions, requirements, or constraints introduced).
- Terminology stays aligned with canonical definitions.
- Readability improves without removing essential qualifiers.

Return-to-intake triggers:
- Proposed wording changes alter semantics or decision posture.
- Ambiguity cannot be reduced without introducing new policy/requirement choices.

- Plan trace line: `improve-writing | trigger | sections edited | semantic escalations | checks passed`.
- Report summary: editorial changes and any deferred semantic clarifications.
