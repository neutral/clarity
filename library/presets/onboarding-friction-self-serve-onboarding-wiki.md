# Preset: Onboarding friction -> self-serve onboarding wiki

Aliases: `Onboarding confusion -> self-serve docs`

Author need: Make onboarding flows self-serve for new contributors/operators.
Start: onboarding guidance is fragmented, implicit, or hard to follow.
Target: clear start-here path, prerequisite clarity, and reliable first-task flow.

Personas:
- Think-as: `developer-power-user`
- Write-for: `end-user`
- Audit: `principal-engineer`, `process-compliance`
- Polish: `technical-editor`

Core actions (minimum):
- create-outline
- add-context
- define-workflows
- cross-link-pages

Conditional actions (triggered):
- If setup contracts are unclear: define-interfaces
- If terminology blocks newcomers: strengthen-definitions, align-terminology
- If onboarding claims are unsupported: add-evidence-links
- If open blockers remain: capture-open-questions
- If section order is hard to scan: shape-flow, improve-writing

Deliverables:
- Start-here onboarding flow with prerequisites and expected outcomes.
- Cross-linked onboarding path to deeper docs.
- Explicit failure/recovery guidance for common onboarding breakdowns.

Checks:
- A newcomer can identify prerequisites, first steps, and completion criteria quickly.
- Onboarding workflow includes error/recovery paths, not only happy path.
- Navigation links support end-to-end onboarding without dead ends.
