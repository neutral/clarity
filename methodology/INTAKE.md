# Clarity Intake

Use these questions to gather intent before changing docs. Summarize answers in
`templates/clarity-brief.md`.

## Required questions
1) Which files, sections, or label sets are in scope for this pass (paths/headings/labels)?
2) Which flow in `FLOW.md` matches the intended clarity outcome?
3) Who is the primary audience and what do they need to do?
4) What parts feel unclear or risky today?
5) Which terms are overloaded or frequently misunderstood?
6) What are the explicit goals and non-goals?

## Optional questions
1) What sources are canonical if conflicts appear?
2) Which decisions are fixed vs open?
3) Are there style constraints (tone, format, length)?
4) What does "done" look like for this pass?
5) Are there deadlines or dependencies that shape scope?
6) Do we need to add or adjust flows/steps/templates before this pass?
7) Should this pass emphasize business/user context or detail depth?
