# Action: capture-market-context

Class: deterministic

Purpose: Make market conditions and alternatives explicit for the project wiki.

Inputs:
- Scope (paths/headings/labels)
- Competitive research, benchmarks, or stakeholder input

Preconditions:
- Market/competitor source set is identified.
- Time horizon for market relevance is defined or implied by scope.

Actions:
1) Summarize the market context or trends that shape the project.
2) List key competitors, substitutes, or alternatives.
3) Note differentiation, gaps, or positioning implications.
4) Link to sources or evidence when available.
5) Mark weakly-supported claims as `Assumption` or `Question`.

Outputs:
- Market Context, Competitive Insight, Opportunity, and Benchmark statements.

Quality checks:
- Market claims include source links or explicit uncertainty labels.
- Alternatives/competitors are tied to positioning implications.
- Time-sensitive claims are not presented as timeless facts.

Return-to-intake triggers:
- Authoritative sources conflict on market facts that affect decisions.
- Market framing changes intended outcome, scope, or non-goals materially.

Plan/report logging:
- Plan trace line: `capture-market-context | trigger | market claims added | source coverage | checks passed`.
- Report summary: market context additions, evidence quality, unresolved conflicts.
