# Clarity Plan

Purpose: shared plan and log for a clarity pass. Owner and agent update it
throughout intake, planning, and execution.

Date started: YYYY-MM-DD
Owner: <name>
Status: <Intake / Planned / In progress / Done>

## Scope

Scope ID:
Paths:
Headings:
Labels:
Exclusions:
Out of scope:
Second-order fixes outside scope (default allowed if bounded/mechanical; e.g., link updates, terminology alignment):

## Compliance controls

Scope-drift budget (max out-of-scope mechanical changes + unit):
Change classification policy (`cosmetic` / `structural` / `semantic` / `decision-impacting`):
Approval policy for `semantic` / `decision-impacting` changes:
Action receipts required? (recommended: yes):
Permissions status path (default `.methodologies/clarity/status.md`):
Read and write allowed paths (from status):
Read-only paths (from status):
No access paths (from status):
Canonical source register path (default `.methodologies/clarity/scratch/canonical-sources.md`):
Locked/open ledger path (default `.methodologies/clarity/scratch/decision-ledger.md`):
Receipts path (default `.methodologies/clarity/scratch/receipts/`):

## Intent

Intended outcome (one sentence):
Primary audience:
Primary use cases (what they need to do):
Goals:
Non-goals:
Known confusions / misinterpretation risks:
Overloaded / frequently misunderstood terms:
Constraints (time, format, policy):
Canonical sources (if conflicts appear):
Fixed vs open decisions:
Definition of done for this pass:
Deadlines/dependencies:

## Personas (per preset)

Think-as persona (default from preset):
Write-for persona (default from preset):
Audit persona(s) (default from preset):
Process-compliance audit persona (recommended `process-compliance`):
Polish persona (default from preset; recommended `technical-editor`):
Persona override rationale (optional):

## Persona control mapping

Think-as control objective:
Think-as failure modes to prevent:
- 
Think-as must-answer questions:
- 

Write-for decision owner and required action:
Write-for failure modes to prevent:
- 
Write-for must-answer questions:
- 

Audit control objective(s):
Audit failure modes to prevent:
- 
Audit must-answer questions:
- 

Process-compliance control objective:
Process-compliance failure modes to prevent:
- 
Process-compliance must-answer questions:
- 

Persona-based checks for audit:
- 

## Intake log

- <question / clarification / decision>

## Baseline scan (within scope)

Current clarity state (WIP, draft, stable):
Hotspots (overlap, drift, missing sections, weak definitions):

## Plan

Preset selected:
Preset source (`../library/presets/overview.md` or custom):
Core actions (from preset; minimum set):
- <action-id>

Conditional actions (from preset; apply when triggered):
- Trigger: <what you observed> -> <action-id>

Added actions (via expansion rule; record why):
- Added action: <action-id>; Trigger: <what you observed>; Artifact: <what it produces>

Audit bar (checks):
- General checks (all pass runs; from `../library/presets/overview.md`):
- Preset checks (selected preset; from `../library/presets/overview.md`):
- Process-compliance checks (all pass runs; from `../library/presets/overview.md`):
- Additional checks (optional):

Audit bar (writing principles, optional):
- <Audience-first / Single source of truth / Explicit scope / ...>

## Execution log

- <date / change / decision>

## Change classification log (rolling)

- Cosmetic:
- Structural:
- Semantic:
- Decision-impacting:

## Action receipts (rolling)

- <action-id> -> `.methodologies/clarity/scratch/receipts/<receipt-file>.md`

## Compliance status (rolling)

- Scope-drift used / budget:
- Permissions compliance status (reads/writes vs status permissions):
- Approval records for `semantic` / `decision-impacting` changes:
- Canonical source register updated:
- Locked/open ledger updated:

## Changes summary (rolling)

- 

## New or updated definitions

- 

## Inconsistencies resolved

- 

## Open questions (rolling)
