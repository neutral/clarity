# Step: define-interfaces

Purpose: Specify system boundaries, inputs, outputs, and contracts.

Inputs:
- Target set (paths/headings/labels)
- Requirements, workflows, or integration notes

Steps:
1) List the external interfaces (APIs, CLIs, data feeds, on-chain hooks).
2) Define inputs, outputs, data shapes, and versioning expectations.
3) Specify error behavior and retry or failure handling.
4) Link each interface to its owning requirements or workflows.

Outputs:
- Requirement and Constraint statements for interface contracts.
