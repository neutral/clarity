# Step: enumerate-edge-cases

Purpose: Capture edge cases and expected behavior to close loopholes.

Inputs:
- Target set (paths/headings/labels)
- Workflows, requirements, or known failure modes

Steps:
1) List edge cases and their triggers for each workflow or requirement.
2) Specify the expected system behavior for each edge case.
3) Add constraints or acceptance criteria when behavior must be verified.
4) Mark out-of-scope edge cases explicitly.

Outputs:
- Edge Case statements with expected behavior.
