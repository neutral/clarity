# Step: apply-positive-framing

Purpose: Replace negative or exclusionary definitions with affirmative, descriptive
statements that explain what something is.

Inputs:
- Target set (paths/headings/labels)
- `../../LABELS.md`

Steps:
1) Scan for negative framing such as "is not," "are not," or "not X but Y."
2) Rewrite each instance into a positive definition or description.
3) Add missing details so the new statement stands on its own.
4) Preserve explicit Non-Goals or Constraints when they are the point of the section.
5) Avoid adding new negative framing in edits.

Outputs:
- Definitions and descriptions framed positively.
- Any necessary Non-Goals or Constraints left intact and labeled.
